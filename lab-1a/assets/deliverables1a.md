# Lab Security Review — EC2, Security Groups, RDS, and Secrets

**Environment:** us-east-1  
**Account:** 778185677715  
**Date:** 2026-02-24  

This document provides a comprehensive technical assessment of the current architecture, validates security posture, and explains key design decisions in employer-credible language.

---

# 🧭 Executive Summary

Your environment demonstrates a **partially hardened cloud pattern** with strong controls around:

- Private RDS
- IAM-scoped secret access
- IMDSv2 enforcement
- Encryption at rest

However, the EC2 instance is still **publicly exposed via SSH and HTTP**, which would not pass most production security reviews.

**Overall posture:** ⚠️ Mixed (Good data-layer security, weak edge posture)

# 🖥️ EC2 Instance Analysis

## Instance Identity

| Attribute | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Instance ID | i-0d38fc923280ebb68 |
| Name | lab-ec2-app |
| Type | t3.micro |
| State | running |
| AZ | us-east-1a |

---

## 🌐 Network Exposure

### Public Interface

| Property | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Public IP | **3.231.93.117** |
| Public DNS | ec2-3-231-93-117.compute-1.amazonaws.com |
| Private IP | 10.180.1.145 |
| Subnet | subnet-0d28bd34e9f2d296e |

### 🚨 Security Assessment

**This instance is publicly reachable from the internet.**

Implications:

- Internet scanners can reach the host
- SSH brute-force attempts likely
- Increases attack surface
- Not aligned with modern zero-trust patterns

---

# 🔐 Instance Security Group Review

## Security Group

| Field | Value |
|------|-------|
| Name | armageddon-public-sg |
| ID | sg-01a0f1bc58d478430 |
| VPC | vpc-013c423ca14ee628e |

---

## Inbound Rules

| Port | Protocol | Source | Description | Risk |
|------|----------|--------|------------|------|
| 80 | TCP | 0.0.0.0/0 | homepage | ⚠️ Public |
| 22 | TCP | 0.0.0.0/0 | secure-shell | 🚨 High |

### 🔴 Critical Finding

**SSH is open to the entire internet.**

This is one of the most commonly exploited misconfigurations in cloud environments.

---

## Outbound Rules

| Protocol | Destination |
|---------|-------------|
| All (-1) | 0.0.0.0/0 |

**Status:** Standard default — acceptable in most architectures.

---

# 🗄️ RDS Instance Review

## Database Identity

| Property | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Identifier | lab-mysql |
| Engine | MySQL 8.4.7 |
| Class | db.m7g.large |
| Port | 3306 |
| Multi-AZ | false |

---

## 🔒 Network Security

### Public Exposure

| Setting | Value |
|--------|-------|
| PubliclyAccessible | **false** ✅ |

**Result:** Database is private.

---

## Subnet Placement

RDS subnet group:

- subnet-030784edc268424b3 (us-east-1a)
- subnet-0963e454eb1bc66a8 (us-east-1b)

**Status:** Proper multi-AZ subnet placement.

---

## Encryption

| Control | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Storage encrypted | ✅ |
| KMS key | Present |
| Performance Insights | Enabled |
| CloudWatch exports | Enabled |

**Assessment:** Strong data-layer posture.

---

# 🔐 IAM Role and Secrets Access

## Attached Policy

- get_secrets_secret_manager

**Purpose:** Allow EC2 workload to retrieve database credentials securely.

---

## Secret Metadata

| Field | Value |
|------|-------|
| Name | lab/rds/mysql |
| Rotation | Not shown |
| Last changed | 2026-01-05 |
| Last accessed | 2026-01-14 |

---

## ✅ Why Secrets Manager Is Superior

Using managed secrets provides:

- Centralized secret lifecycle
- Fine-grained IAM authorization
- Audit visibility
- Encryption at rest
- Runtime retrieval
- Rotation capability

### ❌ Problems With Hardcoding

If credentials were in:

- user-data  
- environment variables  
- source code  

You would lose:

- rotation agility  
- auditability  
- blast-radius control  
- secure storage guarantees  

---

# 🧠 Concept Questions (Validated)

## A) Why is DB inbound source restricted to the EC2 security group?

**Correct reasoning.**

Security group referencing:

- Enforces least privilege
- Prevents arbitrary network access
- Limits lateral movement
- Uses stateful connection tracking

### Security Impact

If the EC2 is compromised:

- attacker still cannot directly access DB from elsewhere
- lateral movement is constrained
- blast radius is reduced

✅ This is the **industry-preferred pattern**

---

## B) What port does MySQL use?

**Answer:** 3306 ✅

---

## C) Why is Secrets Manager better than storing creds in code/user-data?

Your explanation is technically sound.

### Key Advantages

Secrets Manager provides:

- Encryption with KMS
- IAM-based authorization
- API retrieval
- Versioning
- Optional rotation
- Audit trails

**Verdict:** Correct and interview-ready.

---

# 🔐 Least-Privilege Analysis

## Why broader access is forbidden

Allowing wide Secrets Manager access would:

- Increase credential exfiltration risk
- Expand blast radius
- Violate least privilege
- Enable lateral discovery attacks

**This restriction is correct and necessary.**

---

## Why the role exists

The IAM role:

- Enables runtime secret retrieval
- Avoids hardcoded credentials
- Supports secure workload identity
- Enables future rotation

**Design quality:** Good

---

## Why it can read this secret

Because the identity policy explicitly grants:



for the matching secret ARN.

This is proper **resource-scoped authorization**.

---

## Why it cannot read others

Because the policy scope is narrow.

This enforces:

- tenant isolation
- credential boundary control
- least privilege

**This is exactly what security reviewers want to see.**

---

# 🚨 Top Security Findings

## Critical

- SSH open to internet (0.0.0.0/0)
- Instance has public IP

## Medium

- Single-AZ RDS (availability concern)
- No evidence of secret rotation

## Low

- Wide egress (usually acceptable)
- Monitoring disabled on EC2

---

# 🛠️ Recommended Hardening (Production Grade)

## Immediate (High Impact)

- Remove public IP from EC2
- Remove port 22 from internet
- Use SSM Session Manager only
- Move instance to private subnet

## Strongly Recommended

- Enable secret rotation
- Enable EC2 detailed monitoring
- Consider Multi-AZ RDS
- Add VPC Flow Logs
- Add CloudWatch agent

## Elite-Level Improvements

- Add WAF in front of ALB
- Use private ALB + CloudFront
- Implement SCP guardrails
- Add GuardDuty
- Add Inspector

---

# 🏁 Final Verdict

**Data layer:** ✅ Strong  
**Identity model:** ✅ Good  
**Edge exposure:** 🚨 Needs improvement  

You are **very close to enterprise-ready**, but the public EC2 exposure would be flagged in a real security review.

# 💬 Interview-Ready One-Liner

> “The database tier is fully private and IAM-scoped via Secrets Manager; next step is removing direct internet exposure from the compute layer and enforcing SSM-only access.”
